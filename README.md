# VMPAttack
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xnobody/vmpattack/master/screenshot.png "VMPAttack")
 A Work-In-Progress VMP to VTIL lifter.
 Works for VMProtect 3.X x64.

# Usage
 Literally drag + drop the unpacked victim file onto VMPAttack.exe.
 Lifted VTIL routines will appear in a folder named "VMPAttack-Output".

# Issues
 Stability is the main issue. Sometimes the lifter or optimizer can hang unexpectedly.
 The lifter also does not currently handle switch tables.
